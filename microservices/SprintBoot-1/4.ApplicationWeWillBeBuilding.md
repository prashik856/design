# The Application we will be building.

- We'll start form scratch
- Pick one "set" of technonlogies - Spring cloud
- Use only what's required


## Prerequisites
- Java
- Sprint Boot


## Microservices
3 of them
Rate the movies microservice (Just like goodreads)

2 microservices provides some data,
3rd microservice which reads this data and then returns some response

## Movie Catalog API Application
Not to involve database. 
Things might get complicated after involving atabase.

An api, e.g. /api/v1/prashik
-> This will give, 
{
    id,
    name,
    list of movies,
    movies ratings
}
