Object Oriented Modeling

When solving a problem, object oriented modeling involves the practice of 
representing key concepts through objects in your software.
Depending on the problem, many concepts, even instances of people, places, or things,
become distinct objects in the software.

Example seminar room:
Ojbects are:
room itself:
chairs, table, projectors, Person etc.
Each of these objects has it's own attributes.
Each object has it's own behaviour as well.
Person might also be object. It has various attributes and it's own behaviour.
Each object has it's own information
Think of everything as object. Even living things
