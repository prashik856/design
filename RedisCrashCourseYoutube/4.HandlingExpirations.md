# Handling Expirations

Time to live of a key
```bash
ttl name
# returns (integer) -1
# -1 means that it has no expiration at all. It will live on forever.
```

Expire
Make keys expires after some time
```bash
expire name 10
# returns (integer) 1

ttl name
# returns (integer) 8
# This will return the time for which the key will be alive inside the cache
# Once it goes down to 0, it will completely delete the key

# After 10 secs
get name
# returns (nil)
```

Set key with ttl
```bash
setex name 10 value
# returns ok

ttl name
# returns (integer) 9
```
