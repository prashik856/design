# Why so many technologies?

We have a monolith application but we are now trying to break it up to multiple small parts that work together.

Breaking down the microservices, the problems that we are not specific to our application but they are generic.

E.g. how does load balancer works?

We try to solve problems which any microservice will face.

These kind of solutions can be applied to any microservice.

e.g. LB technologies can be applied anywhere.

We have proven patterns, proven technologies which are already estiblished.

Monolith -> Complexity hidden within
Microservices -> Complexity between microservices.
