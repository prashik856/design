# Node js example

```bash
# Once the photos are stored in our redis cluster, we can try to get them using following command
keys *
# returns photos
# this value is stored as 35k lines (the response we will get from /photos)
```

When using redis inside our application, our response time went from 400ms to 60ms (60ms, 30ms, 20ms etc).

```bash
# Let's clear our database and try this out again
flushall
# returns ok

keys *
# returns (empty list or set)
```

Now, when we run our /photos query, we will hit the response time of about 400ms (because query is being done directly to database)
When we run it the first time, it will be a cache miss. But when we again run it, it will return a cache hit, and our response time will be 30ms (Very very fast).

Now, since we are using different albumIds to recognize the photo, we need to make some changes in our key.
Our key should also include albumId inside it.

Once these changes are done, we can now see that our first request took around 120ms but the second request took a whooping 6ms time.


```bash
# Now, after making some changes, let's check redis database
keys *
# returns all the keys with values photo?albumId=1,photo?albumId=2, etc 
```

Now, we can extend our caching function to the other api call as well.
Rather than duplicating the code, we can just create a function and re-use it.
