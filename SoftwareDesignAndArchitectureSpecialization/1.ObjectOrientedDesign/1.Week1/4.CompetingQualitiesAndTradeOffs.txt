Competing Qualities

Satisfying Requirements:
Some software design decisions will involve tradeoffs in different quality
attributes, such as Performance, Convenience, and Security.

What qualities do you often balance in designing software?
> Performance
> Maintainance
> Scalability
> Security, code quality and time to market
> Quality is the real job.
> Balancing competing concerns
> What are non negotiables
> What could we negotiate on.

Context.

Functinal Requirements:
For software, there are functional requirements that describe what the system or application is
expected to do.

Non Functional Requirements:
There are also non functional requirements that specify how well the system or application 
does what is does.
Such requirements may describe how well the software runs in particular situations.
E.g. Minivan and a sportscar have same functions, but the way they do things are very different.
> How well the parts of the code can evolve? > future changes.
So > Reusability
> Flexibility
> Maintanability

The Required qualities should be verified through techniques like reviews and tests.

Certain qualities can be vaildated with feedback from the end users.
