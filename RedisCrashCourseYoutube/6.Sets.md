# Sets

Very similar to list but it only store unique values

```bash
# Create a set
# When we have a value of one more than one work, we can wrap them inside quotes
ssad hobbies "weight lifting"
# returns (integer) 1

smembers hobbies
# returns 1) "weight lifting"
# Returns every value inside hobbies

ssad hobbies "weight lifting"
# returns (integer) 0
# Adding the same value to key will return 0 (false)

smembers hobbies
# returns only weight lifting

srem hobbies "weight lifting"
# returns (integer) 1

smembers hobbies
# returns nothing = (empty list or set)


```
