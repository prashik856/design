# Use Cases and Benefits of a Multi-Model DB?
Assume we have complex social media application, which has many
microservices running at the same time with millions of users.
MS1, MS2, ..., MSN

Assuming we have MySQL for Relational Data,
we have Elasticsearch for really fast filtering (Full-text Search),
Users are connected to each other
(we need Graph Datastructure or Graph Database - neo4j),
Lot of media content (Document Database - mongoDB),
For better performance (Cache Database Redis)

This is a pretty complex setup.
