UML State Diagram:
A State Diagram is a technique that we can use to describe how our system behaves and responds.


State Diagrams:
State Diagrams can describe a single object and illustrate how that object behaves in response 
to a series of events in our system.

State:
A state is the way an object exists at a particular point in time. The state of an object 
is determined by the values of its attributes.

Start state. (Idle)

State has these attributes : State name, state variables, state activities.

Activities: entry/exit/do.

Entry Activities:
Entry activities are actions that occur when the state is just entered form another state.

Exit Activities: 
Exit activities are actions that occur when the state is exited and moves on to another state.

Do Activities:
Do activities are actions that occur once, or multiple times while the object is in a certain state.

E.g. for a clock
entry / unlock spring 
do / ring bell 
exit / lock spring 


Transition:
denoted by arrow from a given state to next state.
event[condition] / action 

E.g while submitting a test. 
Click submit button
[submission date before due date] / Submit Test 
------------------------------------------------>


Termination.
State diagrams are useful for describing the behavior of a system or of a single object.

State diagrams can also help us find issues in our system.
