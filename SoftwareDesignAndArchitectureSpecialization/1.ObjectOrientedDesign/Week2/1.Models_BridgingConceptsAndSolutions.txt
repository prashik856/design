Object Oriented Design (Technical Design).

Our goal is to create Models of each object. 
Initially the focus will be on the Entity Ojbects from the problem space.

In solution space, we have control objects which receive and Coordinate actions.

Then we also have Boundary objects that connects to services outside our system.

These models are often described with a Visual notation caled Unified Modeling Language (UML)

We have different types of UML diagrams to focus on different software issues.
