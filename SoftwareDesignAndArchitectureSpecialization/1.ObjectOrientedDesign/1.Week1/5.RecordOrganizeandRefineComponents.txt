Class Responsibility Collaborator (CRC)

Components, Connections, and Responsibilities when forming a Conceptual Design.

CRC Cards.
Help organize components into classes, identify their Responsibilities and determine how 
they will collaborate with each other.


Consider a Bank Machine:

Conceptual Design using CRC Card.

CRC Cards are used to record, organize and refine the components in our design.

CRC Card:
                    Class Name
        Responsibilities | Collaborators

Collaborators: 
Collaborators are other classes that the class interacts with to fulfill its Responsibilities

How can we use CRC cards while forming the conceptual design?

                    Bank Customer
        Responsibilities | Collaborators
1. Insert Bank card        Bank Machine
2. Choose operation

                    Bank Machine
        Responsibilities | Collaborators
1. Authenticate Bank     | Back Customer 
customer 
2. Display task options 
3. Deposit and withdraw
4. Check Balances


How does a Bank Machine Authenticate the Bank Customer?
Add another component 
                    Bank
        Responsibilities | Collaborators

Bank will communicate via network

                Network

But we want network to be secure,
we add encryption card.
                
                Encryption

Bank Machine itself has many components:
> Card Reader
> Keypad
> Display
> Cheque Slot 
> Card Dispenser

Now, each of these classes can be described as their own CRC card.
