# Discovering Services Through Eureka

How do we consume these eureka services?
To consume these, we need to add another annotation.

Client makes a call to eureka Discovery service but all the code to make these calls is wrapped inside spring boot aplication.

If we deploy the same thing in QA or in Production, we will still be able to run these microservices because now it is using Service Discovery rather than using hardcoded urls.
