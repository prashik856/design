ENCAPSULATION:

Bundle data, and functions that manipulate the data, into a self contained object.
Expose certain data and functions of that object, which can be accessed from other objects.
Restrict access to certain data and functions to only within that object.

Here, the '-' sign denotes that these attributes are hidden from outside the class.
so '-' sign indicates that the method is private.

+ indicates that the attribute is public.


Getter Methods:
Getter methods are methods that retrieve data, and their typically begin with get and end 
with the name of the attribute whose value we will be returing.
Getters often retrieve a private piece of data.


Setter Methods:
Setter methods change data, and their names typically begin with set and end with the 
name of the variable we wish to set.
Setters are used to set a private attribute in a safe way.


e.g.
public class Person{
    private String name;

    public String getName(){
        return this.name;
    }

    public void setName(String name){
        this.name = name;
    }
}
