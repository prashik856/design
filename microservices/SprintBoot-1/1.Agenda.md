# Agenda

- Initially, we usually had a monolith application.
- We may have multiple projects, but at the end we have a monolith deploy.

- Microservices changes that.

## Agenda
- Creating a few microservices
- Having them communicate with each other

we will have microservices talk to each other. Get a cohesive piece of functionality.

We can have hardcoded code.
We can also have service discovery and then have microservices talk to each other.


## Where do you start?
- Lots of technologies
- Lots of patterns
- Interdependent concepts
- Why?
