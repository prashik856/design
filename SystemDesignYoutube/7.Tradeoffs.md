# Tradeoffs

## Diminishing Returns
The diminishing returns of vertical scaling.
With increase in CPU cores, we don't have a lot of performance improvements
Even if we are doubling the amount of money, we don't actually get that kind of performance.
This is a limitation to vertical scaling.
and again risk of not having redundant servers.

## Latency
Advantage of horizontal scaling is we can have our application running on multiple data centers all across the world.
E.g. if we are playing video games, we need the client to connect to server as fast as possible so there is no lag.
If we just have a large single server, we will have a big issue of lag.
With horizontal scaling and multiple servers running around the world, we can have lower latency, brighten up user experience.

- Vertical scalability costs rise sharply after a certain point (Need more capacity, so cost increases exponentially)
- Initial costs associated with horizontal scaling tends to be higher (Because of complexity)
- Horizontal scalability becomes much more efficient after a certain point.
We need to change the architecture of our app to always support horizontal scaling.
