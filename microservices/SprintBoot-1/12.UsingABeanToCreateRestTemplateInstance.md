# Using a Bean to create a RestTemplate Instance

Is it necessary to add the @Bean annotation? Or does Spring register all classes that are @Autowired?
- Autowired is a consumer. We are telling spring to give us something of type defined.
- Bean is a producer. It tells Spring Boot that it has something. Please save it, other people might need it.


When does the method to create the bean get executed? When the bean is used/called?
- This is configurable. We can either lazy initialize bean (after call) or eager initialize beans (all bean objects are created at startup)
- Default might be lazy
- Lazy initialize will first create the instance of the class, then it will catch Autowired which will trigger the creation of the required bean.


Are the @Bean methods always specified in the main application class? Or can they be anywhere else?
- It could be anywhere. As long as the class is a spring bean itself, it could be defined anywhere.


Should the method name be the same as the property that needs to be injected to?
- Name doesn't matter. The type matters.

What happens if we have two beans of the same type?
- We will get an error.
- To bypass this, we need an annotation or some thing way. Now then when we autowire, we need to give that type defined in the annotation.
- Typically just one instance.
