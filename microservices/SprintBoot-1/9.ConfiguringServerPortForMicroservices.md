# Configuring server port for microservices

Configure the three microservices to run on a different port each.
8081, 8082, and 8083

We need to edit resources/application.properties file. 
We can give key values configuration here.
server.port=8081

Where is the tomcat server coming from? is it a part of the Sprint Boot Application?
- Part of each sprintboot application.
- We run the same way in production as well.
- We just run the jar file


What if we need to configure that tomcat instance? Is it possible to do that?
- We are doing that right now. We are changing port, which is changing tomcat properties.
- Tomcat run as it's own process


We have 2 spring boot applications running now.

Make every port manually configured. Always.
