# Recap and Next Steps

Now, we ran 2 instances of microservice which client side load balancing happens

## How fault tolerance works?
- What happens if a service goes down?
- Client -> Can I get service 2? 
- Discovery server -> Here it is. This is service 2.
- But then, since service 2 is down, it won't be able to find this.

## Solution?
- Send "heart beats" to service registry
- Spring application by default sends heartbeats to Eureka Server.
- Eureka Server by default comes with functionality to check heart beats of clients, and if they are recorded, it will consider the clients to be down.
- This is not a 1 time discovery.

## What if Discovery Server goes down?
- This is where cache comes into play.
- Client - Can I get Service 2 please? 
- We get error from Discovery Server
- Client - No response! I'll just look up from my cache for now.
- This is what Eureka Client is doing (which is already embedded code)

## Recap
- Multiple Microservices
- handed communication between them
- then we used service discovery with eureka server
- Created Eureka server and clients
- Used Loadbalancer to leverage client loadbalancing provided by Eureka
- Learned Discovery Server

## Next Steps
For now, we have completed Microservices Level 1: Communication and Service Discovery
Where to go?
We can lookup the Documentation for Spring Boot techonologies.

Microservices Level 2:
Fault Tolerance and Resilience
