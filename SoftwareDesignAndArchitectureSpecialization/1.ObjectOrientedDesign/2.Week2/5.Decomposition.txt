DECOMPOSITION.

Decomposition is taking a whole thing and dividing it up into different parts. Or, on the flip side,
taking a bunch of separate parts with different functionalities and combining them together 
to form a whole. Decomposition allows you to further break down problems into pieces that are 
easier to understand and solve.

> Look at the different responsibilities of some whole thing and evaluate how we can separate them 
into different parts.


For a Car: Wheel, engine, gas pidal, seats, doors, windows, etc.

A whole: Finxed or Dynamic number of certain type of part.

> E.g. refrigerator has a fixed number of freezers but different amount of food.

Fixed parts don't change in number overtime.

Parts can also contain parts.
For a car > Engine contains fuel, etc.


Lifetimes of a whole object: e.g. refrigerator and the freezers have the same lifetimes.
If we dispose of one, the other cannot sustain.
But food and refrigerator have different lifetimes.

Similarly, car cannot sustain without engine.
