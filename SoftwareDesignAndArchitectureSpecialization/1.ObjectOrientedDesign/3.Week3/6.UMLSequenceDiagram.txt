UML Sequence Diagram:

Sequence Diagrams:
A Sequence Diagram describes how objects in our system interact to complete a specific task.

Name of class in a box.
: Person 

Vertical dotted line to represent life line (as the time passes by)

Use -> (arrows to show messages that are sent from one object to another)


Sequence diagram can have multiple sequence diagram inside them.
E.g. For ATM process, we have a big ATM box to describe the whole process, and then we 
have separate diagrams for Withdrawal and Deposit.


Change TV Channel
If there are people in our diagram, we use stick figures (actors.). No need to draw a box around them.
Here only two classes are there(Remote and Television.)
To send data, we use bold arrow. 
To return data, we use dotted arrow.
: TV Viever                     : Remote                        : Television

|   -> Press Numbers(number)        
|                               -> Change Channel(number)
