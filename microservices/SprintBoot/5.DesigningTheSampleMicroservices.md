# Designing the sample microservices

## Movie Catalog Service
Given a name, this will return a array of moves
Input: UserID
Output: Movie list with details

## Movie Info Service
Input: Movie ID
Output: Movie Details
Microservices has their own databases

## Ratins Data service
Storing the ratings of all the users.
Input: UserID
Output: MOvie IDs and ratings

- Create 3 Spring Boot Projects
- Build movie catalog service API
- Build movie info service API
- Build ratings data service API
- Have movie catalog service call the other two services (the naive way)
- Implement a better way (Service Discovery)

Is it possible to have the end client directly call the individual microservices and collate the data on the client side?
UI can make the call directly to microservies too.
