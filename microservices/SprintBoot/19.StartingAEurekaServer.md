# Starting a Eureka Server

How do we start it?
How do we create an Eureka Server?
- We need to add that depency as well.
- We need to start a spring application to start Eureka Server.

When we start eureka server, it will initially throw errors because we haven't registered any clients to eureka.
It will also throw a bunch of other errors. To resolve them, we need to add these properties in application.properties file
```
eureka.client.register-with-eureka=false
eureka.client.fetch-registry=false
```
These are the properties which we add to tell eureka not to register itself.
Every eureka server is also a eureka client.
We can have multiple instances of eureka servers too. And they can register with each other.
Since we just have 1 server, we add the above properties to stop acting like a client.

This prevents a bunch of errors that we usually get.
