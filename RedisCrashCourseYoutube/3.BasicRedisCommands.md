# Basic redis commands

Once we are inside the redis, we can quit using quit command
```bash
quit
```

Add things to database (Run redis-cli command first)
```bash
SET name prashik

# Get value
GET name
# Should return "prashik" as value
```
Everything we store inside redis will be stored as a String by default

```bash
SET age 26

GET age
# return "26"
```

Delete a key
```bash
DEL age

GET age
# Returns (nil)
# This is because we deleted that key
```

Exist command
To check if this key exists or not
```bash
EXIST name
# returns (integer) 1

# If we try to get something which isn't ther
EXIST ne
# returns (integer) 0
```

Pattern matching for the keys
```bash
KEYS *
# returns all the keys (for now, it will return only 1 because it is only storing 1 key)
# 1) "name" 

# A great way to see what is stored inside the database
```

Delete everything inside the database
```bash
FLUSHALL
# returns OK
# Deletes everything

KEYS *
# returns (empty list or set)
```

Put data inside redis after clearing
```bash
set name prashik
# returns ok

get name
# returns prashik
```

Clear screen
```bash
clear
```
