## How Redis Works?

### How does Redis support multiple data formats in a single DB?
We have Redis Core, which already supports multiple types of data
as a key value pair
(Strings, Bitmaps, BitField, Hashes, Lists, Sets, Sorted Sets, Geospatial,
Hyperloglog, Streams)

Extend with Redis Modules - RedisSearch, RedisGraph, RedisTimeSeries,
RedisJSON

All of these are Modular. So these types of different databases are not
tightly coupled with each other.

Pick and Choose which functionality we need for our application.

Redis Core is out of the box Cache which is also acting like a Database
- Less complex, no need to implement a caching layer

Redis is In-Memory Database is Fast and Performant DB (Faster
Application and Faster tests)

Redis is Schemaless. So it doesn't need time to initialize schema
before running the tests.
