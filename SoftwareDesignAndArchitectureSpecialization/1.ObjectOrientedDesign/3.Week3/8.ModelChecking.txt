MODEL CHECKING

How do we make sure that the system we created is correct?

Our Model should never enter a Deadlock state:
A deadlock is a situation where our system cannot continue because two tasks are waiting for 
the same resource.

State Model:
A state model is an abstract state machine that can be in one of various states. The model 
checker then checks that the state model confirms to certain behavioral properties.


The three different phases to performing model checking:
The Modeling phase 
The running phase 
The Analysis phase
