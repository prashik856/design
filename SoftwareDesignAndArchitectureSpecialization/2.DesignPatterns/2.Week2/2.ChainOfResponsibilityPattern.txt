CHAIN OF RESPONSIBILITY PATTERN:

Design Patterns

A Chain of Objects that are responsible for handling requests

Chain of Handler objects that are linked together.

Example:
We have a screw and a top of tools, but we don't know which will work.
What do we do? We try each tool on the screw and see which one works.

Similar to Exception handling in Java.


Where to use this?
In email service
An email come, we have a series of Filter objects which will filter the incoming mail.

Each filter should go through the following steps:
- Check if rule matches
- If it matches, do something specific
- If it doesn't match, call the next filter in the list.
To achieve this, we can use the Template pattern[Each filter should follow those particular steps]
