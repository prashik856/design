# Challenges of multiple data services
- Data services need to be deployed and maintained
- Know-How needed for each data service
- Different Scaling and Infrastructure Requirements

Effort increases to maintain these services

To avoid all this, we can used Managed services?
- Microsoft Azure
- Google Cloud
- AWS (Amazon Web Services)

But this is very expensive.

- More complex application code for interacting with different DB
- Higher Latency (Slower), because more network hopping.
