# Primary Backup Replication

What kind of failures replications are supposed to deal with?

## Failures
- Fail-stop faults: if something goes wrong, the computer just stops. 
Fan stops working. Network cable cut down. Power cut down.
These are covered.

Bugs in hardware and software are not covered. We cannot defend against
this.

Some can be turned into fail stop errors. Example are network error 
and disk block (something wrong with disk)

We are expected to handle only fail-stop faults.

Natural disasters can affect our replications.
It is better to spread replicas along different regions for availability.

## Types of Schemes and Strategies
- State Transfer Replication :
Primary sends copy of its entire state (RAM) to its secondary.

- Replicated State Machine: Just operations from external input or 
external events. Usually operations are smaller than a state.
