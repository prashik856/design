# Saving Costs with Redis on Flash

Durability + Recovery with Redis is achievable!

But Storing data in memory expensive?
- more servers compared to disk-based databases. This is because
  memory is limited in size.

Have large Redis DBs, but at a significant cost savings.
It has something called as Redis on Flash.
How does this work?

Standard Redis operation:
Everything in RAM (keys + all values)

Redis on Flash (Uses disk)
Hot values (or frequenctly used) values are stored in RAM
Warm values (infrequently used) values are stored in SSD.
More RAM-like (latency and performance) on the server.

Redis can use more of the underlying infrastructure resources by
using both ram and ssd.
