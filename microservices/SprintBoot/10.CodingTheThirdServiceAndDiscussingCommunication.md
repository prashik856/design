# Coding the third service and discussing communication

Create hard-coded API in ratings-data-service to return a rating given a movie ID: /ratings/data

What we have now:
1. Movie info service
2. Movie Catalog Service
3. Ratings Data Service

We will make first connection
Movie-info-service to movie-catalog-service

## How to make a REST call from your code?
- Calling Rest APIs programatically
- using a REST client Library
- Spring Boot comes with a client already in your classpath - Rest Template
- WebClient is required instead of RestTemplate. RestTemplate is depreciated.
