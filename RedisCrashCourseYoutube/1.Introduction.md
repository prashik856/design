# Introduction

## What is redis?
- Type of Database (Nosql database).
- All the data in redis is stored in key value pairs.
json: key: "name", value: "Prashik"
That's it. Redis is a giant key value pair store.
- Not important to store bunch of different datastructures.
- Redis, rather than working on the disk, it actually runs on the ram of our computer.
- This means that redis is incredibly fast.
- Much more volatile. If something goes wrong, whole redis will crash and we will lose all the data unless we back it up.
- Redis is really not used as a persistent storage, but it is usually used for caching. Just store precalculated data in redis and whenever that value is again accessed, it can be accessed directly from redis.
- It is usually built on top of a traditional database (or a persistant storage)
- So, usually when writing anything on the database, we store it inside redis as well as inside the database, so that the next query is really quick
- Makes our app performace better (10 to 50 times better).
