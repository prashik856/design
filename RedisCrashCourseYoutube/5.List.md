# Lists

Redis also supports arrays and hash

List
```bash
# We have key friends which has value prashik inside the array
lpush friends prashik
# returns (integer) 1

get friends
# returns (error) WRONGTYPE Operation against a key holding the wrong king of value
# Get only works for strings

# To actually get the array, we need to use lrange
# lrange <key> <start-index> <end-index>
# -1 is to get everything
lrange friends 0 -1
# returns 1) "prashik"
# because it is the only value stored

lpush friends raut
# returns (integer) 2

lrange friends 0 -1
# returns 1) "raut"
#           2) "prashik"

# Add the value to the end of the Array
rpush friends mike
# mike will be added at the end of the array

lrange friends 0 -1

# Take the items on and off the array
# We use lpop and rpop for this

lpop friends
# removes raut and returns it to us

lrange friends 0 -1
# returns prashik and mike

rpop fridns
# removes mike and returns it to us

lrange friends 0 -1
# returns only prashik
```
List is useful when we want to store a queue or stack.
We want to cache the five most used messages from the user.
