# System Design Performance Metrics

## Scalability
1. Ability of a system to grow and manager increased traffic
2. Increased volume of data or requests
Goal is to achieve this scalability without loss of performance
Bad system design can result to bottleneck or exponential increase in cost to serve small increase in traffic

## Reliability
1. Probability a system will fail during a period of time
2. Slightly harder to define than hardware reliability
Easy with hardware. In software, our responses can slow down or something other happens.
Need automated testing to pervent bugs from being deployed.
Tools to perdict and compensate for hardware failure.
We can take that server offline and repair it beforehand.

## Mean time between failure
mtbf = (Total Elapsed time - total downtime)/number of failures
(24 hours = 4 hours)/4 failures = 5 hours mean time between failures

## Availability
1. Amount of time a system is operational during a period of time
2. Poorly designed software requiring downtime for updates is less available
Site down for maintainance
e.g. upgrades for a database
Now a days, that is not the issue.

Availability % (available time / total time) * 100
(23h / 24h) * 100 = 95.83%
