# Distributed Systems

## Introduction 
A Set of cooperative computers working together to get something done.
- if a single computer can do it, plesae do it.
- try everything else before going to distributed systems.

- Achieve Parallelism
- Fault Tolerance (if one of them failes, we go over to other one)
- Physical Reasons (Data centers spread across the globe)
- Split up the computations
- Security / isolated
We can have partial failures because network is included in the architecture.

## Basic Challenges
- Concurrency
- Partial failure
- Performance

Very important part of computer infrastructure.

We have lab assignments too.

## Components
- Lectures (Ideas on Distributed systems)
- Papers (Classic Papers used in Distributed Systems and solving these difficult problems)
Read the papers before attending lectures
- Exams 
- Labs
- Project (Optional)
