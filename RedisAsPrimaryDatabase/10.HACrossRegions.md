# HA Cross Regions
High Availability and Performance across multiple geographic locations

Use Cases:
Users geographically distributed.
- We want to distribute our data service close to the users for
  better performance

Disaster Recovery
- Switch over to another data center, when one goes down

Replicas of Redis Cluster in different regions.
Data should be replicated to all clusters.
Each cluster should be able to accept reads/writes

Local Cluster of Europe region and Local Cluster of US region
- Each regis cluster acts as local instances in each region
- Syncers contact remote masters for replication
- Sync is a compressed and secured stream

This is called Active-Active Geo Distribution (in paid version)
For this, we have lower latency for the users and we have disaster
recovery.

Redis cluster can update data still independently.
Sync data when connection is re-established.

How does Redis resolve changes to the same dataset?
How does Redis ensure data consistency?

For this, paid Redis uses CRDT - Conflict-Free Replicated Data Types

This is used to resolve all the conflicts in the database level

E.g.
Conflict: Concurrent SETs
Conflict resolution: Last Write Wins

Conflict: Append vs Del
Conflict resolution: Add wins

Outcome of concurrent writes is predictable and based on a
set of rules
Dataset will eventually converge to a single, consistent state

Each data type has its own conflict resolution rule
All parallel changes are intelligently resolved.
