# Why you should avoid returning lists in APIs.

We have an API which returns the list of movies and their ratings. Assume that in the future, we want to inhance the API and also return users full name.
Now, if we add our API whcih returns User's full name, the api is going to break other people's code, as they are expecting a return type as list.

Now, if we return an object rather than a list, this won't be a problem, as we can just add another field in our object which won't affect the other customers using the API

This is a reason we have an object wrapper when we usually return a list. 
This makes sure that our APIs are backward compatible.
