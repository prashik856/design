# Technology : Eureka

Spring cloud uses eureka for service technology. Very commonly used.
Netflix made eureka open source.
netflix also created a bunch of different libraries for microservices

Libraries made open source by Netflix:
- Eureka
- Ribbon
- Hysterix
- Zuul

Spring builds a lot of Abstraction (wrappers) to make things easier for us.
It also gives us abstraction with jdbc.

## Sprint Boot / Spring Cloud abstraction layer
We will use Spring Cloud and eureka to get service discovery working.
For this to work, we need a Eureka Server (Discovery Server) running and we need Eureka Clients (All microservice services) running.
Eureka clients registers with Eureka Server.
Client needs to be an Eureka Client too.

## Steps to making this work
- Start up an Eureka Server
- Have microservices register (publish) using Eureka client
- Have microservices locate (consume) using Eureka Client
