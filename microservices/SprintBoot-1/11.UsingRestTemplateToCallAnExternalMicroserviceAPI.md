# Using RestTemplate to call an external microservice API

How about using abstract classes or interfaces and sharing those between microservices? The implementations could be different classes in each microservice.
- We can. We are going to run into dependency issues between microservices. We need the data model of microservices to be different, so if we make a copy of response class, it would be better. We can make whatever changes that we want to that class.

What happens when these classes change? And there are changes in the API response in one microservice and there are other microservices consuming it?
- Versioning is a very very different topic. 


Aren't these calls synchronous? Is there a way we can make these calls asynchronously?
- Yes, we can. That's where WebClient comes into picture.
