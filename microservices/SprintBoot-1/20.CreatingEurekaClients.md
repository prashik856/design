# Creating Eureka Clients

Exercise:
1. Add the Eureka Client dependency to have the 3 microservices register with Eureka server

Why is the version property required?
- Because fot this dependency, we need to provide the version
- We can do that here, but we have multiple spring cloud dependencies and we have to put versions for all of those
- This is one way of avoiding that
- We didn't do this before because we didn't have any spring-cloud dependencies before

For movie-info-service to be registered to Eureka Server, we need to have server.port as 8761 (the default port of eureka server). Without it, the movie-info-service will fail to register itself to Eureka Discovery Server.

How did the client find where the Eureka Server is? How did it know where to register?
- Right now, we have used the default Eureka port. Since we have used default port in Eureka Discovery Service, this application is able to register itself
- If Eureka is using a different port, we will need to give a property to specify the different port.

Adding the same dependency to all other microservices so that they act as a Eureka Client
