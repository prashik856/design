These design patterns are used when a decision must be made at the time of instantiation of a class (i.e. creating an object of a class).

Types of Creational Design Patterns:
1. Factory Method Pattern
2. Abstract Factory Pattern
3. Singleton Pattern
4. Prototype Pattern
5. Builder Pattern
6. Object Pool Pattern
