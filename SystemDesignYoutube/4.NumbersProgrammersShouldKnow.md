# Numbers Programmers should know
Estimations
General system design where we need to consider trade offs.

## Latency Numbers
Access Type         Time        Converted Time
CPU Cycle           .3ns        1S
CPU L1 Cache        1ns         3S
CPU L2 Cache        3ns         9S
CPU L3 Cache        13ns        43S
Main Memory (RAM)   120ns       6 minutes
SSD                 150us       6 days
HDD                 10ms        12 months
SF To NYC           40ms        4 years
SF To Australia     183ms       19 years

Looking at the scale, we can see how time can impact our latency. Calls to other data center can have a lot of performance drops.

ms vs ns makes a hugggge difference. 
We can see the difference in online gaming.
20ms and 100ms make a huge online gameplay experience.


Library <-----------  Disk <- Desktop(Ram)(CPU)
CPU (The office we are currently working on)
Ram (book shelf, we leave our office) (takes time)
We would like to keep our data as close as possible

## Latency Key Takeaways
1. Avoid network calls whenever possible
2. Replicate data across data centers for disaster recovery as well as performance
3. Use CDNs to reduce latency
4. Keep frequently accessed data in memory if possible rather than seeking from disk, caching.
