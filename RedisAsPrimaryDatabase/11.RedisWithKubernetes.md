# Redis with Kubernetes
Great fit for microservices with multiple data types

How does redis runs on kubernetes?

As an open source deployment, deploy redis as Helm Chart or K8s
manifest files.
Use the replication and scaling rules
Hosts are K8s Pods instead of virtual or physical servers

Effort of maintaining third-party Redis service?
Paid redis has a managed redis cluster which we can deploy
as a K8s Operator.
K8s Operator - Bundle all resources to operate a certain service
- How to create the db cluster
- How to run it
- How to synchronize the data
- How to update

Instead of manual work, we have a "software" operator which
manages these works for us.

Many DBs has operators for kubernetes (MySQL operator,
elastic-operator, postgress-operator)

Visit operatorhub.io for more information.

Redis has its own operator (Redis Enterprise Operator) which
automates deployment and config of redis db.
It also takes care of Scaling, Backups and Recovering
