Mostly, performance is the key issue during the software development and the object creation, which may be a costly step.
Object Pool Pattern says that " to reuse the object that are expensive to create".

an Object pool is a container which contains a specified amount of objects. When an object is taken from the pool, it is not available in the pool until it is put back.

 Objects in the pool have a lifecycle: creation, validation and destroy.

A pool helps to manage available resources in a better way. There are many using examples: especially in application servers there are data source pools, thread pools etc

Advantage of Object Pool design pattern
It boosts the performance of the application significantly.
It is most effective in a situation where the rate of initializing a class instance is high.
It manages the connections and provides a way to reuse and share them.
It can also provide the limit for the maximum number of objects that can be created.

Usage:
When an application requires objects which are expensive to create. Eg: there is a need of opening too many connections for the database then it takes too longer to create a new one and the database server will be overloaded.
When there are several clients who need the same resource at different times.
