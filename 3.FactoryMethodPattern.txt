Factory Method Pattern

A Factory Pattern or Factory Method Pattern says that just define an interface or abstract class for creating an object but let the subclasses decide which class to instantiate. In other words, subclasses are responsible to create the instance of the class.

The Factory Method Pattern is also known as Virtual Constructor.

Usage of Factory Design Pattern
When a class doesn't know what sub-classes will be required to create
When a class wants that its sub-classes specify the objects to be created.
When the parent classes choose the creation of objects to its sub-classes.
